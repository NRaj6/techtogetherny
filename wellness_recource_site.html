      <il> Get the person to stand up</il>
      <br>
      <il> Position yourself behind the person.
      </il>
      <br>
      <il> Lean the person forward and give five blows to their back with the heel of your hand. </il>
      <br>
      <il> Place your arms around their waist</il>
      <br>
      <il> Make a fist and place it just above the navel, thumb side in</il>
      <br>
      <il> Grab the fist with your other hand and push it inward and upward at the same time. Perform five of these abdominal thrusts
 </il>
      <br>
      <il> Repeat until the object is expelled and the person can breathe or cough on their own</il>
    </ol>

        <br>
        <il> ICE: apply an ice pack (covered with a light, absorbent towel to help prevent frostbite) for 10 minutes, then remove for 10 minutes. Repeat this as often as possible for the first 24 to 48 hours after your injury. If you don’t have an ice pack, a bag of frozen vegetables will work fine. </il>
        <br>
        <br>
        <il> COMPRESSION: Wrap the affected area with an elastic medical bandage (like an ACE bandage). You want it to be snug but not too tight. If the skin below the wrap turns blue or feels cold, numb, or tingly, loosen the bandage. </il>
        <br>
        <br>
        <il> ELEVATION: Raise the sore body part above the level of your heart. Doing so reduces pain, throbbing, and any internal bleeding that can lead to bruises. </il>

      <h1> Anxiety Attacks </h1>
      <h3> What are Anxiety Attacks?</h3>
      <p> Anxiety attacks (also known as panic attacks) are intense periods of fear or feelings of doom developing over a very short time frame -up to 10 minutes- and associated with symptoms including sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, dizziness, derealization, fear of dying, and numbness. </p>
      <br>
      <h3> Treatments </h3>
      <p> There are a variety of treatments that can help you control your anxiety. It's all about finding the one that fits you the best! </p>
      <ul>
        <il> Counselling: talking to a therapist </il>
        <br>
        <il> Yoga/meditation </il>
        <br>
        <il> Exercise can help you calm your mind. Some examples include rolling your shoulders, going for a run/bike ride and talking a walk.
</il>
        <br>
        <il> Getting back to a calmer state of mind by telling yourself to take a step back, and that you don’t have to do “this”. Be sure to ‘turn the volume down’ to give yourself peace of mind. </il>

     <h1> Why is Meditation Important? </h1>
    <p> Meditation helps relieve stress, making you more focused and more aware. It can also slow your aging process since it helps balance the body's system. Meditation can also greatly improve your mood and make you a generally happier person. </p>
     <br>
     <br>
     <h3> How to Effectively Meditate </h3>
     <ul>
       <il> Sit or lie down in a comfortable spot. </il>
       <br>
       <il> Close your eyes and breathe normally. </il>
       <br>
       <il>Take care to feel how your body moves with each breath. Be aware of how your ribs, chest and stomach. </il>
       <br>
       <il> Clear your mind and try to stay focused on your breathing. </il>
       
     <h3>Breathing Exercises</h3>
       <ul>
         <il> Nadi Shodhana (Alternate Nostril Breathing): Release fatigue and tension with this calming breath. Take the thumb of the right finger and close off the right nostril. Inhale deeply and slowly through the left nostril. Use the right pinkie finger to close off the left nostril and exhale slowly through the right nostril. Continue this alternate breathing for a minimum of three minutes, maximum 31 minutes. Also a great option to do right before bed to calm a busy mind.</il>
         <br>
         <br>
         <il> Sitali Pranayam (The Cooling Breath): The act of drawing the air across the tongue and into the mouth is said to have a cooling and calming effect on the nervous system. Roll the tongue into a “U”shape with the tip just outside the lips. Inhale slow and steady through the U shaped tongue filling the diaphragm. Exhale through the nose. Continue for three minutes. If this is too difficult, you can also try Sitkari Pranayama which has the same effect. Open the mouth slightly with your tongue just behind the teeth. Inhale slowly through the space between the upper and lower teeth, letting the air come in over your tongue as you lift your chin up toward the sky. At the end of the inhalation, close the mouth and exhale through the nostrils as you slowly lower your chin back to neutral. Repeat for 8 to 12 breaths. Both Sitali and Sitkari Pranayama are a particularly good way to wake up if you feel tired in the morning or even during an afternoon slump when you want to improve your focus. </il>
         <br>
         <br>
         <il> One Minute Breath: This exercise soothes fear and is said to help cognition. 20 seconds to inhale, 20 seconds to hold breath, 20 seconds to exhale. To start, inhale slowly, filling the lower abdomen, stomach area, lungs and then finally, the chest. Hold the breath in for 20 seconds and then slowly exhale for 20 seconds. Work your way up to 20-20-20. Continue for a minimum of three minutes. </il>
         <br>
         <br>
         <il> Breath of Fire: Rapid breath of fire is enlivening and cardiovascular; it improves the strength of the lungs, heats the body, and promotes quick energy. Begin in a comfortable seat and sit up tall. Keep the mouth closed through this breathing exercise. Relax the muscles of the stomach.Take a deep inhale through the nose and exhale through the nose. Begin to breathe rapidly through the nose and pump the naval point in and out with each breath. Maintain an equal emphasis on the exhalation and inhalation. The breath should be shallow so it can be quick. </il>
        <br>
         <br>
         <il> Box Breath: This exercise is very similar to the One Minute Breath. Keep your mouth closed throughout this breathing exercise. Relax the muscles of the stomach. 4 seconds to inhale, 4 seconds to hold breath, 4 seconds to exhale, 4 seconds to hold breath. To start, inhale for 4 seconds, filling the lower abdomen, stomach area, lungs and then finally, the chest. Hold the breath in for 4 seconds, slowly exhale for 4 seconds, and then hold for 4 seconds. Continue in that order for a minimum of three minutes. </il>
       </ul>

      <h1> How to Deal with the Loss of a Loved One </h1>
      <p> Losing a loved one is never an easy thing to deal with. Here are some tips to help.      <h3> Accepting Your Emotions </h3>
      <p> Moving on from the loss of a loved one takes time. Don’t feel bad feel about your emotions, rather accept them. Accepting your feelings and understanding why you feel the way you do will help you get through emotional times. </p>
      <br>
      <h3> Self Care </h3>
      <p> Take care of yourself and your family. Eating well, exercising and getting plenty of rest help us get through each day and move forward. </p>
      <br>
      <h3> Reach out and help others dealing with their loss </h3>
      <p> Helping others can be therapeutic, and help you deal with your loss as well. Sharing stories of the deceased is also a good way to cope with the loss.</p>
      <br>
      <h3> Celebrate the lives of your loved ones </h3>
      <p> This is one is more up to interpretation. Some ideas include donating to their favorite charity, or putting up a picture of them. Any way that honors your relationship with them is a good way to remember them. </p>
